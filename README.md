"IOT data will be sent into Azure Event Hub. Once the data is in Azure Event Hub, it will be consumed in Azure Databricks where a pre trained machine learning model will be applied on the incoming data. The processed data will then be sent into another Event Hub from where it will be visualized on a streaming Power BI dashboard"
